# Coding Movement-with Genes

## Rules:
- The blue platform is safe
- The AI will die if they fall into the Lava.

## There's 6 actions that could be taken by the AI :
1. Walking forward
2. Walking backward
3. Walking to the left
4. Walking to the right
5. Jumping
6. Crouching


## There are 2 separate goals that I want the AI to achieve :
1. Who can survive the longest on the blue platform (time) ‚åõ
2. Travels the most (distance)üõ£Ô∏è

## **Constant parameters**
- Population : 100
- 5 Seconds for each generation

## **Findings**
1. **Surviving the longest**
- The population would end up doing the strategy that keeps them alive the longest which are **JUMPING** and **CROUCHING**.
2. **Travelling the most**
- The population would end up moving to where there is more ground to avoid falling into the lava.
